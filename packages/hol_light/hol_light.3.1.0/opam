synopsis: "The HOL-Light interactive theorem prover"
description: """
HOL Light is a computer program written by John Harrison to help users prove
interesting mathematical theorems completely formally in higher order logic.
It sets a very exacting standard of correctness, but provides a number of
automated tools and pre-proved mathematical theorems (e.g. about arithmetic,
basic set theory and real analysis) to save the user work. It is also fully
programmable, so users can extend it with new theorems and inference rules
without compromising its soundness. There are a number of versions of HOL,
going back to Mike Gordonâ€™s work in the early 80s. Compared with other HOL
systems, HOL Light uses a much simpler logical core and has little legacy code,
giving the system a simple and uncluttered feel. Despite its simplicity, it
offers theorem proving power comparable to, and in some areas greater than,
other versions of HOL, and has been used for some significant
industrial-scale verification applications.

This package will install `hol.sh` which will run OCaml REPL with HOL Light
loaded.
To use a compiled module of HOL Light, please install with the
hol_light_module OPAM package.
