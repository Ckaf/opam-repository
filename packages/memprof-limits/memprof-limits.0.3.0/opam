synopsis: "Memory limits, allocation limits, and thread cancellation"
description: """\
Memprof-limits provides per-thread global memory limits, per-thread
allocation limits, and cancellation of threads, with ways to
ensure resource-safety after interruption.

Global memory limits let you bound the memory consumption of a task,
in terms of the major heap size.

Allocation limits let you bound the execution time of a task measured
in number of allocations. Allocation limits do not count
deallocations, and are therefore a measure of the work done, which can
be more suitable (reliable, portable, deterministic) than wall-clock
time.

Token limits lets you cancel a (CPU-bound) task preemptively and at a
distance.

Tasks are interrupted by raising an asynchronous exception.
Memprof-limits provides resource-management features and guidance for
reasoning about the consistency of state in the presence of such
interrupts.

The implementation uses OCaml's Statmemprof engine with a low sampling
rate that does not affect performance. Memprof cannot be used on the
same domain as memprof-limits, but a compatible reimplementation of
the Memprof interface is provided for your profiling needs."""
